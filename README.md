# Our Company Handbook
*A Collaborative Handbook for our Thenavigo Team & Community*

This repository serves these purposes:

1. Gives a high-level overview of who we are, what we do, and why we do what we do
2. Our compensation, benefits, and employment policies for our staff and team
3. A cultural glossary of practices, principles, and operating virtues
4. And anything else we might think of...

It's a work-in-progress, something designed to be touched by anyone in our community. I'm particularly interested in getting feedback from new community members as you all will see things that the current team may unintentionally (and intentionally) ignore! Please help us identify our blindspots and **question everything**—[kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen)!

I'm so grateful that you're here and that you've decided to commit a season of your life helping to build _meaningful_ and _impactful_ software for the Thenavigo community! You're here because success isn't possible without you.
