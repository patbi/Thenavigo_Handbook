# Our Company Handbook
*A Collaborative Handbook for our Navigo Team & Community*

This repository serves these purposes:

1. Gives a high-level overview of who we are, what we do, and why we do what we do
2. Our compensation, benefits, and employment policies for our staff and team
3. A cultural glossary of practices, principles, and operating virtues
4. And anything else we might think of...

It's a work-in-progress, something designed to be touched by anyone in our community. I'm particularly interested in getting feedback from new community members as you all will see things that the current team may unintentionally (and intentionally) ignore! Please help us identify our blindspots and **question everything**—[kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen)!

I'm so grateful that you're here and that you've decided to commit a season of your life helping to build _meaningful_ and _impactful_ software for the Navigo community! You're here because success isn't possible without you.

[Feel free to [email me](mailto:biyagapatrick@gmail.com) at any time!]

## Operating Virtues

Ben Horowitz via his book [What You Do is Who You Are](https://amzn.to/338OBm7) helped us frame our own:

>Bushido looks like a set of principles, but it’s a set of practices. The samurai defined culture as a code of action, a system not of values but of virtues. A value is merely a belief, but a virtue is a belief that you actively pursue or embody. 
>
>The reason so many efforts to establish “corporate values” are basically worthless is that they emphasize beliefs instead of actions. Culturally, what you believe means nearly nothing. What you do is who you are.

Consequently, here are our current `operating virtues` (taken from our [blog](https://patbi.hashnode.dev/le-projet47-ck3lc9oie00pqeas17q9m3xuu)):


### 1. Table All The Things — `#`
Or, in other words, we “put everything out on the table” — the good, the bad, and most definitely the ugly. Information is the lifeblood of our business which is especially true in a distributed-first organization. This means that we share things in real-time: We don’t wait for the timing to be “perfect” and we’re comfortable with sharing incomplete, imperfect, and unpolished prose. 

Consequently, this means that what we share is going to be, quite often, incomplete, imperfect, and in sore need of serious polishing — we treat all updates with respect, knowing of the courage required to share something that may make the person look foolish, silly, or even stupid. Instead, we engage graciously, responding to the update with the care and attention that we’d hope to receive if it was our own, knowing that they’ve successfully modeled this virtue with excellence.

Finally, #sha means that we’ll often share things that are intensely personal and are only meant for those presently at our table. Everything shared in our communication tools should be held in the highest regard and with strict confidence.

Our table is strong when trust is the foundation.


### 2. Speed of Decision Making — `#`
No bullshit: We are in a fight for our very survival and every single day we make life-altering decisions — sometimes, with very little data. Regardless, we agree with General Patton when he said “A good plan, violently executed now, is better than a perfect plan next week.” 

That “plan”, by the way, is our first operating virtue, #sha, because our team has mastered the art of communicating plainly the high-level context, the people involved, and the decision(s) that need to be made and by what time (and by whom). We clearly state if consensus or feedback is required and, with enough collective confidence that we can bear, we commit to the decision, even if we may personally disagree. We move the fastest when we are aligned, feelings aside.

Otherwise, you should #sha, providing all the above data and informing the team of your decision with a request for specific people to keep you accountable — this simply means that you will do what you say you’ll do and you’re asking for support in keeping that commitment on track.

## Our Vision

Create a community that protects and releases energies.







## Our Story

It all started on January 27, 2018 as a small personal challenge: I (Patrick Biyaga) wanted to try my hand at building a social network, posting at least one post from my work every week for a whole year. It was hard and, to make a very short story short, I was able to finish the project but only with the help of the Tutorials from (Traversy Media): it provided a ton of features, inspiration and encouragement for me to get to the end and deploy it on Heroku.

And ... it worked! But not like I had planned or expected. You see, while the site was online not a lot of registrants were using it, but needless to say I felt like I was on to something exciting.

At the beginning #challenge, I worked on creating a number of digital products, including educational websites, web and hybrid applications, This momentum leads me to focus on high-impact products/services, So I focus on one service namely SeeDoc: which is a web/mobile healthcare platform for almost two years, and during this time I win challenges namely:

1 - Startup Istanbul where I'm invited to present my project in October 2020.

2 - TEF2020 organized by the Tony Elumelu Foundation I am also pre-selected to follow a training of entrepreneurs to benefit from a funding of $5000.

I don't stop there I continue to apply for other challenges and decide to follow an entrepreneurship training at [YStartupSchool](https://www.startupschool.org/companies/fSMX9-jjeksa9Q?fbclid=IwAR1vytooA--F4rz6V9QuzC8JaltoNKG-GdRRVNdM1UZm3xY7u0yVRv71yJs). 


in my researches on the web, in order to see if there's not an open source project that has been done for me so that I can compare the approaches of development of a social network (architecture/design/deployment/technologies), I came across Amir Movahedi who had actually developed an open source social network project and there I got in direct contact with him. like any open source project you have to polish it up so that it can be unique. 

I make a proposal to change the direction of the open source project and turn it into a Q&A Community completely different from what has been done [Navigo](https://projet47.herokuapp.com/). of course before we participated in the battle of the startups on [Pioneer](https://play.pioneer.app/), but I found that I was wasting time there and that I had to decide to launch on my own.

When the training at YStartupSchool ends I decide to contact a former Promoter of my first engineering school IAI-Cameroon, to talk about the [SeeDoc project](http://seedocs.herokuapp.com/) and if he can accompany us. we enter into discussion and at the end of this exchange we sign a Rapid Investment Agreement (AIR) contract.

Which allowed us to finalize these two projects Navigo and SeeDoc in style and to add much-needed internal community members (i.e. staff) after the Post-Covid period.

































## Cultural Quirks

Here are a few things that aren't immediately obvious about us and our team.

**How we refer to ourselves**

- Legally, we are `ROFLCOPTER, INC.` But other than legal docs, you’ll rarely see this.
- Most commonly, we refer to team, project, company as our core product, Navigo.
- Navigo (all caps) is not an acronym.
- You’ll also see accounts under [#](#) or `navigoio` or `NavigoFTW` or `Navigo` (sometimes we couldn’t get just Navigo)
- If "Navigo" is combined with another word, it's not capitalized (e.g. `NavigoIQ`)

**Some terms you’ll see tossed around:**

- `Navigoizen` - Members of our amazing community
- `Navigoiverse` - What we're building as well as our community space
- `Navigoi` or `Navigoni` (what community members named the company mascot, the [Navigoicorn](#))

**My Meeting, My Notes**

- When you call or 'own' the meeting, you are responsible for taking notes and dispersing them along with action items after the meeting so those who weren't able to attend are made aware. We usually just drop those in Slack post-meeting.























































































## Policy Changes and Legal Stuff
*The only constant is change...*

We want all of our policies to be living documents which can improve and change as we learn and grow as a company. This is how we'll propose and make changes to our policies.

Right now, we use the following tools to discuss the Handbook:

1. **GitHub** - The canonical resource. Feel free to open a pull request with context!

2. **In Person Meetings** - Our hope is that as we grow and scale, we'll have more opportunities to gather in-person and virtually to discuss the #handbook openly.



#### Handbook Use, Policy

This Employee Handbook describes the employment policies applicable to all employees of the Company. Where there are differences in the terms applicable to employees in different jurisdictions, the differences are noted in the Handbook. This Handbook is not a contract, express or implied, guaranteeing employment for any specific duration.

This Handbook is designed to familiarize employees with the employment policies of Navigo. Employees should read, understand, and comply with all provisions of the Handbook. It describes many of the responsibilities of an employee and outlines the programs developed by Navigo to benefit its employees.

No Employee Handbook can anticipate every circumstance or question about policy. As Navigo continues to grow and as business needs, employment legislation and economic conditions change, Navigo reserves the right to revise, supplement, or rescind any policies or portion of the Handbook from time to time as it deems appropriate, in its sole and absolute discretion. No statement or promise by any other member of the Company can be interpreted as a change in policy nor will it constitute an agreement with an employee. Employees will be notified of such changes to the Employee Handbook as they occur.

Should there be any discrepancy between the Handbook and other documents of the Company, the policies incorporated in the Handbook shall govern. This Employee Handbook supersedes any and all other previous Navigo Employee Handbooks or other Navigo policies, whether written or oral.

Policies set forth in this Handbook are not intended to create a contract, nor are they to be construed to constitute contractual obligations of any kind or a contract of employment between Navigo and any of its employees. No person can enter into an employment contract with Navigo for a specified period of time or make any agreement contrary to this policy without written approval from CEO.

The provisions of the handbook have been developed at the discretion of management and may be audited, amended or cancelled at any time, at Navigo’s sole discretion. Whenever the word “Company” is used, it refers to the employer, “Navigo”.
