# Our Company Handbook
*A Collaborative Handbook for our Thenavigo Team & Community*

This repository serves these purposes:

1. Gives a high-level overview of who we are, what we do, and why we do what we do
2. Our compensation, benefits, and employment policies for our staff and team
3. A cultural glossary of practices, principles, and operating virtues
4. And anything else we might think of...

It's a work-in-progress, something designed to be touched by anyone in our community. I'm particularly interested in getting feedback from new community members as you all will see things that the current team may unintentionally (and intentionally) ignore! Please help us identify our blindspots and **question everything**—[kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen)!

I'm so grateful that you're here and that you've decided to commit a season of your life helping to build _meaningful_ and _impactful_ software for the Thenavigo community! You're here because success isn't possible without you.

## Our Story

My name is [Patrick Biyaga](https://about.me/biyaga), I am the Founder of Thenavigo & See-Docs and Freelance.

Patrick Biyaga started coding for fun, creating applications for his friends, then doing IT services. About seven years ago, I started freelancing as a web developer for startups and ONG(s). I created a lot of applications, and then someone gave me the idea to always have my own personal project, a suggestion that had a big impact on my career and my local community. Today, I am a web developer at See-Docs and Thenavigo.

After seven years of building apps for startups, in between alumni, I asked myself, "Why not explore the founding solo journey by creating the See-Docs and Thenavigo platforms, since I'm a web developer? We don't have any healthcare apps in my community, but in the big city, there are tons."

I took the challenge and created these simple healthcare and (educational) applications for local patients in Cameroon, which I call See-Docs | Thenavigo! Patients have a quality service at their fingertips and it is free. "My goal is to provide this service to this community and to start making progress with our users, and potential paying users", "Today we have potential partners interested in our projects to make them high potential projects.
